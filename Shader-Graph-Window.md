## Description

The **Shader Graph Window** contains the workspace for creating shaders using the **Shader Graph** system. To open the **Shader Graph Window** you must first create a [Shader Graph Asset](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ShaderGraph/wiki/Home). For more information see the [Getting Started](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ShaderGraph/wiki/Getting-Started) section.

The **Shader Graph** window contains various individual elements such as the [Blackboard](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ShaderGraph/wiki/Blackboard) and [Master Preview](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ShaderGraph/wiki/Master-Preview). These elements can be moved inside the workspace. They will automatically anchor to the nearest corner when scaling the **Shader Graph Window**.

## Title Bar

The title bar at the top of the **Shader Graph Window** contains actions that can be performed on the **Graph**.

| Item        | Description |
|:------------|:------------|
| Save Asset | Saves the graph to update the [Shader Graph Asset](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ShaderGraph/wiki/Home) |
| Show In Project | Hightlights the [Shader Graph Asset](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ShaderGraph/wiki/Home) in the [Project Window](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/ProjectView.html) |

## Context Menu

Right clicking within the workspace will open a context menu. Note that right clicking on an item within the workspace, such as a [Node](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ShaderGraph/wiki/Node), will open the context menu for that item and not the workspace.

| Item        | Description |
|:------------|:------------|
| Create Node | Opens the [Create Node Menu](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ShaderGraph/wiki/Create-Node-Menu) |
| Cut | Cuts selected [Nodes](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ShaderGraph/wiki/Node) to the clipboard |
| Copy | Copies selected [Nodes](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ShaderGraph/wiki/Node) to the clipboard |

| Delete | Deletes selected nodes |
| Duplicate | Duplicates selected nodes |
| Collapse Previews | Collapses previews on all [Nodes](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ShaderGraph/wiki/Node) |
| Expand Previews | Expands previews on all [Nodes](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ShaderGraph/wiki/Node) |
