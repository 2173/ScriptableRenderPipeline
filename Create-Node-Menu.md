## Description

The **Create Node Menu** is how to create [Nodes](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ShaderGraph/wiki/Node) in **Shader Graph**. To open the **Create Node Menu** either right click on the workspace in the [Shader Graph Window](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ShaderGraph/wiki/Shader-Graph-Window) and select **Create Node** or press spacebar.

At the top of the **Create Node Menu** is a search bar. You can search for a node by typing any part of its name in the search field.

All [Nodes](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ShaderGraph/wiki/Node) that are available in **Shader Graph** are listed in the **Create Node Menu** categorised by their function. Any user created [Sub-graphs](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ShaderGraph/wiki/Sub-graph) are also available in the **Create Node Menu** under **Sub-graph Assets**.

Selecting a [Node](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ShaderGraph/wiki/Node) in the **Create Node Menu** will add it to the workspace.
